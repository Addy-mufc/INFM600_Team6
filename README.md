Parking at the University of Maryland has always been a big problem. Even though every student buys a parking space, it is often the case that they cannot find a parking space. As each courseâ€™s location is in different buildings across the campus, the distance between many classrooms is quite far. This situation requires a better parking 
management system to help schools plan parking spaces more intelligently to help students at the University of Maryland.
